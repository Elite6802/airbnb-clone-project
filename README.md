## Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern full-stack ecosystem to build, secure, and deploy a scalable booking platform.

- **Django**: A Python web framework used to build the backend services, handle authentication, manage business logic, and expose APIs for core features like listings, reservations, and payments.

- **MySQL**: A relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as users, property listings, bookings, reviews, and transactions.

- **GraphQL**: An API query language used to allow clients to request exactly the data they need from the backend, improving efficiency and reducing over-fetching compared to traditional REST endpoints.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across machines and servers.

- **GitHub**: A platform for version control and team collaboration, used to manage the repository, track issues, and streamline development workflows.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, used to automate building, testing, and deploying the application to ensure reliable delivery.

- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used to create and format documentation files like this `README.md`.

- **Security Tools & Practices** (e.g., JWT, input validation, OWASP guidelines): Applied throughout the project to protect user data, secure API endpoints, and prevent vulnerabilities.


## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone project requires a relational database to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below is an overview of the core entities, their important fields, and how they are related.

### Entities and Fields

- **Users**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `password_hash`
  - `role` (guest, host, admin)

- **Properties**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `location`
  - `price_per_night`

- **Bookings**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
  - `start_date`
  - `end_date`
  - `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

- **Reviews**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
  - `rating` (1–5)
  - `comment`

- **Payments**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
  - `amount`
  - `payment_date`
  - `payment_status` (pending, completed, failed)

### Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- Each **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.  
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.  
- Each **Review** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.  
- Each **Payment** is tied to exactly one **Booking**.  


## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature is designed to provide a seamless experience for both guests and hosts while ensuring scalability and security.

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Supports multiple roles such as guests, hosts, and admins, each with specific permissions. This ensures secure access control and a personalized experience for different types of users.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with details such as title, description, location, images, and price per night. This feature is central to connecting hosts with potential guests and drives the platform’s core offering.

### Booking System
Provides guests with the ability to search for available properties, make reservations, and manage bookings. This feature handles availability checks, prevents double-booking, and tracks booking status from pending to confirmed or cancelled.

### Reviews and Ratings
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This fosters trust and transparency in the community, helping future guests make informed decisions while encouraging hosts to maintain high-quality standards.

### Payment Integration
Supports secure payments linked to bookings, including tracking of amounts, statuses, and transaction dates. Ensures smooth financial operations and protects both hosts and guests by confirming payments before check-in.

### Security and Authentication
Implements robust security measures such as password hashing, JWT/session authentication, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP). This ensures that user data and transactions remain safe at all times.

### CI/CD and Deployment
Integrates continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker. This automates testing, builds, and deployment, ensuring faster delivery cycles and reducing human error in the release process.


## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical for protecting sensitive user data, ensuring safe transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the Airbnb Clone platform. The following measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
Only verified users can access protected resources using secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication. This prevents unauthorized access and protects user accounts.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to ensure users only perform actions allowed by their role (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents malicious actions like guests modifying property data or accessing admin dashboards.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.). This ensures that only safe and expected data interacts with the database and APIs.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling
API endpoints will be protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks. This maintains platform stability and ensures fair usage.

### Secure Payment Processing
Payment APIs will use encryption and follow PCI DSS compliance standards to secure financial data. Protecting transactions is critical to building trust between guests and hosts.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. This ensures data remains secure even if intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties.

### Logging & Monitoring
API activity will be logged and monitored to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches. This allows quick detection and response to threats before they escalate.
